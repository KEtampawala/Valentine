        <h2>Yayyyy baby 🥹💕</h2>
        <p>I am deeply grateful to have you in my life, in a way that feels as pure and important as the love I have for my parents 🤍. I truly want to walk through life with you, to grow together, and I hold a quiet hope in my heart that one day I will be your wife 👰🏻‍♀️ and we will share a happy, peaceful life together until my very last breath 😘💍. Through my past mistakes, I have come to realize that you are the best choice I have ever made, and I am truly sorry for the hurtful things I have done 🥺💔. Even when I struggled to express myself and said things imperfectly, you stayed with me patiently and calmly, and that kindness means more to me than words can say . I love you deeply, and I am thankful every day that you chose to stay 👩🏻‍❤️‍💋‍👨🏻🌎.</p>
        <p><b>Happy Valentine’s Day Mnikaaa 💋</b></p>
